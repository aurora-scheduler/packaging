aurora-scheduler (0.23.0) xenial; urgency=medium

  * First release as a stand-alone project.
  * Updated to Mesos 1.7.2.
  * Updated node dependencies including eslint to 7.5.0.
  * Bumped up Node version to 12.18.3
  * com.github.node-gradle.node plugin bumped up to 2.2.4
  * Added UNSAFE prefixes to the required functions in react code.
  * Updated Quartz Scheduler to 2.3.1
  * Updated Gradle to version 5.6.4
  * Updated Guava to 29.0-jre
  * Updated SpotBugs to 4.2.0
  * Updated Commons to 3.10
  * Updated Guice to 4.2.3
  * Improved the way Updates handle paused/resumed updates where instance updates previously
    failed. Previously, upon resuming a paused update, previously failed updates would be retried.
    This would make updates take longer than expected, specifically when using the auto*pause
    mechanism.
  * Modified auto-pause mechanism to address a corner case where the status of an instance in a batch
    would not enter a terminal state before the batch was paused. This resulted in undesired behavior
    when the updated was resumed if that instance update had failed.
  * Auto-pause update mechanism now makes sure all instances have entered a terminal state
    [SUCCEDED, FAILED] before pausing the update. With this change, the final pause to
    acknowledge an update had sucessfully completed has also been dropped.
  * Support has been added to use a resource with the key ips from Mesos.
